Surprise
========

Overview
--------
This consists in my variant of the [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) 
library. I have added several functionalities that might not be fully 
documented or tested beyond my current use. Use at your own risk! For more 
info about the original library refer to README_SURPRISE.md.
 
Added functionalities
----------------------
The added functionalities consist in the possibility to add user or item 
features, and sample weights. New accuracy metrics and prediction algorithms
are also provided. The current examples do not include these new 
functionnalities.
 
TODO
----
- Update documentation.
- Update examples.
- Update tests.
